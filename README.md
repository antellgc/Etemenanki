# Etemenanki
> "Computers are like Old Testament gods; lots of rules and no mercy."
> ~ Joseph Campbell

Etemenanki is Sumerian for "temple of the foundation of heaven and earth" and is the name of a ziggurat in the city of
Babylon. Originally 91 meters in height, little remains of it now except ruins. Etemenanki is considered a possible
inspiration for the biblical story (or even literal candidate for the tower itself) of the Tower of Babel.

+ Bible chapter summaries were accessed from http://www.biblesummary.info/ using Beautiful Soup.

# Methods
+ Extractive summarization
+ Topic modeling
